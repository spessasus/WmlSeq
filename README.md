## WmlSeq
A simple sequencer using [spessasynth library](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth). Slightly modified `sequencer.js` file and around 30 lines of code.

Uses [WebMidiLink](https://www.g200kg.com/en/docs/webmidilink/spec.html) level 0.

I couldn't find a good WML sequencer so I made my own :)

I guess that's it, that's the readme. Have a cookie 🍪
